# Guided Project: Personality Quiz

  
「In this unit, you learned about the UIKit framework and its controls. You also learned how to manage the position and size of views and controls using Auto Layout and stack views, while managing the flow of your app using navigation and tab controllers. Now you'll combine all that knowledge to build an app. For this guided project, you'll create a personality quiz. Maybe you've seen this type of game before. Players are presented with a light-hearted topic and answer questions that align them to a particular outcome. Here are some examples of personality quiz topics: What animal are you? What country should you visit next? Which Apple product are you? 」

「There are no correct answers to quiz questions. Answers are purely subjective, and their results don't even have to be logical. For example, suppose you design a quiz called "What country should you visit next?" You could pose the question "What is your favorite color?" and decide that the answer "green" aligns to Italy and not to France. Other questions and answers might make more sense. If the player prefers sushi over pasta, you could award points for Japan instead of for Italy. This guided project will use "Which animal are you?" as the quiz topic. The four possible outcomes are: dog, cat, rabbit, and turtle. But if you prefer to choose your own topic and outcomes, go ahead. As long as you're following the steps in the project, any topic is fine. You'll learn more if you're having a good time. 」

\#\#Part One—Project Planning 

Rather than diving directly into Interface Builder or Swift, it's important to think about the goals and requirements of your personality quiz. Who's your target audience? Maybe you have a topic in mind, but what features will the quiz include? What models and views will you need to accomplish those features? 」
